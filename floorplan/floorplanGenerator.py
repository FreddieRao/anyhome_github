        Task: You are a talented Architectural Planner tasked with envisioning the floorplan for a house described as {}. Your need to generate four things as described below:

        Requirements:
        1. Complete Room List: Compile a comprehensive list of all rooms within the house. The list should adhere as close as possible with the house description given. If a room type appears multiple times, append an index to differentiate them. Without exceeding the house description, aim for a diverse assortment of rooms, covering a wide range of functionalities. You can generate any room type for the complete room list. For example, if the house features two bedrooms and one dining room, list them as: "[bedroom1, bedroom2, dining room1]".
        2. Modified Room List: Adapt the previously listed rooms into a standardized set of room types based on their functionality and the house's style. Use only the following room types: kitchen, storage, bathroom, study_room, balcony, living_room, bedroom, entrance, dining_room, and unknown. Transform unique rooms to the closest match from the predefined list, appending an index if necessary. If a room does not match any predefined type, label it as "unknown".
        3. Room Connections: Map out the connectivity between rooms, detailing which rooms are directly accessible from each other. Present this information as a list of tuples, indicating room pairs that share a connection. For instance, if the dining room connects to both bedroom1 and bedroom2, but there is no direct connection between the two bedrooms, list the connections as: "[[dining_room1, bedroom1], [dining_room1, bedroom2]]". The room names should be from the complete room list that you've generated at requirement 1.
        4. Front Door Locations: Identify the rooms that house the main entrances to the dwelling. Specify each room that contains a front door, considering it as the primary access point to the house.

        Output: Provide the information in a valid JSON structure with no spaces. Don't include anything beside the requested data represented in the following format:
        {{
            "complete_room_list": [...],
